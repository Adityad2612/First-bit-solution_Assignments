1. Login to MySQL and view all databases already present. You should get
following result :
---> show databases;


2. Write an SQL statement to create a simple table countries including columns
country_id,country_name and region_id. After this display the structure of
table as below :
--->  create table countries
    -> (country_id int(11), country_name varchar(20),
    -> region_id int(11));
    ->desc countries;


3. Write an SQL statement to create a table named jobs including columns
job_id, job_title, min_salary, max_salary and check whether the
max_salary amount exceeding the upper limit 25000. Also set job_id as
primary key and entering null values for job_title is not allowed.
--->  create table jobs
    -> (job_id int primary key, job_title varchar(15) not null,
    -> min_salary decimal(7,2), max_salary decimal(6,2),
    -> check (max_salary <=25000));
    -> desc jobs;


4. Write a SQL statement to create a table named job_histry including columns
employee_id, start_date, end_date, job_id and department_id
--->  create table job_histry
    -> (employee_id int primary key, start_date date,
    -> end_date date, job_id int not null, department_id int not null);
    -> desc job_histry;


5. Write an SQL statement to alter a table named countries to make sure that no
duplicate data against column country_id will be allowed at the time of
insertion.
---> alter table countries
    -> modify country_id int unique;
    -> desc countries;


6. Write an SQL statement to create a table named jobs including columns job_id,
job_title, min_salary and max_salary, and make sure that, the default value
for job_title is blank and min_salary is 8000 and max_salary is NULL will be
entered automatically at the time of insertion if no value assigned for the
specified columns.

--->create table jobs
    -> (job_id int primary key, job_title varchar(15) not null,
    -> min_salary decimal(7,2) default 8000, max_salary decimal(6,2),
    -> check (max_salary <=25000));
    -> desc jobs;


7. Create a Department table with following structure

---> create table department
    -> (DEPARTMENT_ID decimal(4,0),department_name varchar(30) default NULL,
    -> MANAGER_ID decimal(6,0),LOCATION_ID decimal(4,0) default NULL,
    -> primary key(DEPARTMENT_ID,MANAGER_ID));
    ->alter table department
    -> modify column DEPARTMENT_ID decimal(4,0) default 0;
    -> modify column MANAGER_ID decimal(6,0) default 0;
    ->modify DEPARTMENT_NAME varchar(30) NOT NULL;


8. Write an SQL statement to create a table employees including columns
employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number hire_date, job_id,
salary, commission, manager_id and department_id and make sure that, the
employee_id column does not contain any duplicate value at the time of
insertion and the foreign key columns combined by department_id and
manager_id columns contain only those unique combination values, which
combinations are exists in the departments table.

--->create table employee
    -> (employee_id decimal(4,0) primary key, first_name varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    -> last_name varchar(20) NOT NULL,email varchar(20) unique,
    -> phone_number int,hire_date date NOT NULL,job_id int NOT NULL,
    -> salary int,commission int,manager_id int NOT NULL,
    -> department_id int not null);
    ->alter table employee
    -> modify column manager_id decimal(6,0);
    ->drop column department_id;
    ->add column department_id decimal(4,0)
    -> after commission;
    ->ALTER TABLE employee
    -> ADD CONSTRAINT fk_dept_mgr
    -> FOREIGN KEY (department_id, manager_id)
    -> REFERENCES department (department_id, manager_id);
